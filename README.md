# Electrical Engineering Resources

A collection of (mostly free) resources for learning Electrical Engineering online.
There are dozens of Github repos for learning Programming or DS&A, I'd like to do the same thing for Electrical Engineering.
I have tried to keep it to mostly free resources but the nature of the subject at the moment seems to involve a lot of textbooks, hence "mostly free".

If you have anything to add, please make a pull request!

## Fundamentals

### Textbooks

- [The Art of Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266) A classic. If you are looking for a textbook with minimal maths, this is it. Great as reference material for designers as well.

### Videos

- [Electroboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn4J8RcMGrM&list=PLr_CZLgMkHeWFl1uf5yR2ouhIh00ycHn9)
- [EEVBlog](https://www.youtube.com/c/EevblogDave) Australian, covers everything.
- [ECSE Design Fundamentals - Aaron Lanterman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQTn3DQYYB4qaEC9KRK5mHNK)

## PCB Design and Layout

### Concepts

- [Altium Academy Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AltiumAcademy)

### Specific tools
