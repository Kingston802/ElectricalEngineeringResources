# Electrical Engineering Resources

A collection of (mostly free) resources for learning Electrical Engineering online.
There are dozens of Github repos for learning Programming or DS&A, I'd like to do the same thing for Electrical Engineering.
I have tried to keep it to mostly free resources but the nature of the subject at the moment seems to involve a lot of textbooks, hence "mostly free".

If you have anything to add, please make a pull request!

## Fundamentals

### Textbooks

- [The Art of Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266) If you are looking for a textbook with minimal maths, this is it.

### Videos
